## Path Callbacks and Handlers

Understanding path callbacks and handlers is key to understanding how Bullet
parses requests and how it tries to respond to them. Path callbacks are always
matched first, and then handlers are executed once the path has been fully
consumed and their criteria has been met.

## Path Callbacks

In your application built with Bullet, a **path callback** is what you will
use to structure your URLs and organize your code. Path callbacks are what
Bullet is looking for when trying to respond to a particular request URI.
In terms of code, path callbacks will use the `path` and `param` methods on
the main Bullet application object.

The `path` method matches an exact static path name, and the `param` method
matches the path based on a registered callback. There are lots of
pre-registered [param callbacks](/docs/param-callbacks) and it's easy to add
your own custom ones too.

The following example matches `posts/235`, but not `posts/my-post-title`.
{% geshi 'php' %}
$app->path('posts', function($request) use($app) {
    $app->param('int', function($request, $postId) use($app) {
        return "Post: " . $postId;
    });
});
{% endgeshi %}

<div class="alert alert-info">
Path callbacks are only concerned with
matching the URI segment itself, and have no other matching rules or context.
</div>

## Handlers

Handlers are what Bullet uses to send an HTTP response once a path has been
fully matched. Handler methods are `get`, `post`, `put`, `delete`, `patch`,
`method`, and `format`. Handler methods are what you should use to contain most
of your application logic, because handler methods will never be executed unless
the full URI has already been matched.

In this example, a `GET /posts/12` will only execute the second `get` handler.
The first `get` handler will be ignored because the path was not fully matched
at that point (only `posts` and not the full `posts/12`), and the `post` handler
will be ignored because the request does not match that handler's criteria (it
was a GET request).

{% geshi 'php' %}
$app->path('posts', function($request) use($app) {
    // Get posts collection
    $app->get(function($request, $postId) use($app) {
        return "GET  /posts";
    });

    $app->param('int', function($request, $postId) use($app) {
        // Get single post resource
        $app->get(function($request) use($app, $postId) {
            return "GET  /posts/" . $postId;
        });

        // Update single post resource
        $app->post(function($request) use($app, $postId) {
            return "POST  /posts/" . $postId;
        });
    });
});
{% endgeshi %}

<div class="alert alert-info">
  Handlers are only matched when the entire URI has been fully consumed, and
  the handler criteria has been matched.
</div>

Multiple hanlders can be nested, and **all** of them will be executed when the
path has been fully consumed. The most common use for this is combining both an
HTTP method handler and a format handler. An example `GET /posts` with an HTTP
header `Accept: application/json` would match the _json_ format handler.

{% geshi 'php' %}
$app->path('posts', function($request) use($app) {
    $app->get(function($request, $postId) use($app) {
        // Prepare your data ONCE
        $data = array(
            array('title' => 'Foo', 'author' => 'Calvin'),
            array('title' => 'Bar', 'author' => 'Hobbes')
        );

        // Respond in multiple formats
        $app->format('json', function($request) use($app, $data) {
            return $data;
        });
        $app->format('html', function($request) use($app, $data) {
            return $app->template('posts', $data);
        });
    });
});
{% endgeshi %}

<div class="alert alert-info">
  Bullet uses automatic content-negotiation to determine the request format by
  parsing the `Accept` header in the absense of an explicit file extension.
</div>

Returning the raw array for JSON requests will automatically `json_encode` the
array and send the appropriate JSON response `Content-Type` header.
