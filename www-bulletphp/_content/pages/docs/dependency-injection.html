## Bullet and Dependency Injection

[Dependency injection](http://www.martinfowler.com/articles/injection.html) is
a powerful design convention that can help separate your app routing logic
from the external services it needs (like a database connection, a user
management system, and so on). That separation means your app will stay
lightweight and flexible, easier to modify and better able to absorb external
changes.

Bullet itself is built on [Pimple 1.x](http://pimple.sensiolabs.org/), a simple
dependency injection container, so injection capability is automatically
available in your apps.

## Revisiting the Bullet Blog

Our blog so far uses two external services:

* `somehowGetBlogMapper()`, a function that returns a database mapper for the
  blog content and operations
* A `Post` object that we use to create a new blog post

Let's work on that first one. `somehowGetBlogMapper()` currently takes no
arguments, which means it must be figuring out the database connection
internally. That's not very flexible--if we wanted to change the connection
settings, we'd have to go fiddle around in the middle of the function. If there
are more functions that need a database connection, we'd have to go fiddle with
all of them!

Let's change our blog mapper by adding the database connection as a parameter
(a.k.a. injecting a dependency):

{% geshi 'php' %}function somehowGetBlogMapper($database_connection) {
    // use $database_connection to get the blog mapper
}{% endgeshi %}

Great, much more flexible! Let's try using it in our Bullet app:

{% geshi 'php' %}$app = new Bullet\App(array(
    'template.cfg' => array('path' => __DIR__ . '/templates')
));
 
// 'blog' subdirectory
$app->path('blog', function($request) use($app) {
    $blog = somehowGetBlogMapper(/* where do we get the connection? */);
});{% endgeshi %}

Whoops, we've painted ourselves into a corner. If `somehowGetBlogMapper()`
doesn't know how to get the database connection itself, that means the `/blog`
route has to:

{% geshi 'php' %}// 'blog' subdirectory
$app->path('blog', function($request) use($app) {
    $database_connection = somehowGetDatabaseConnection();
    $blog = somehowGetBlogMapper($database_connection);
    
    // ... more paths and handlers here ...
});{% endgeshi %}

Wait, now the route has to know about the connection **and** the mapper? That
doesn't seem more flexible!

## Enter Pimple

Lucky for us, our Bullet app doubles as a
[dependency injection container](http://www.sitepoint.com/dependency-injection-with-pimple/).
Let's teach Bullet how to create a database connection:

{% geshi 'php' %}$app['database_connection'] = $app->share(function() {
    return somehowGetDatabaseConnection();
});{% endgeshi %}

The `$app->share()` method means that our database connection will be created
only once, the first time we request it. Every subsequent request will use the
same connection.

Now that Bullet knows how to create our database connection dependency, we can
inject it into the `/blog` route:

{% geshi 'php' %}// 'blog' subdirectory
$app->path('blog', function($request) use($app) {
    $blog = somehowGetBlogMapper($app['database_connection']);
    
    // ... more paths and handlers here ...
});{% endgeshi %}

That's an improvement; now the route gets the database connection right from
`$app`. Can we keep going, and teach Bullet to create the blog mapper itself?

{% geshi 'php' %}$app['database_connection'] = $app->share(function() {
    return somehowGetDatabaseConnection();
});
$app['blog_mapper'] = function($app) {
    return somehowGetBlogMapper($app['database_connection']);
};

// 'blog' subdirectory
$app->path('blog', function($request) use($app) {
    $blog = $app['blog_mapper'];
    
    // ... more paths and handlers here ...
});{% endgeshi %}

Whoa, what happened there?

* We taught Bullet to create a database connection.
* We taught Bullet to create a new blog mapper using that database connection.
  (Notice how we didn't use `$app->share()` for the mapper? That means Bullet
  will run `somehowGetBlogMapper()` every time the `blog_mapper` is requested.)
* In the `/blog` route, we
  [asked Bullet directly](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RlfLCWKxHJ0) for the
  blog mapper, without worrying about the database connection.

Using Bullet's built-in dependency injection container, we've managed to not
only make our database connection available from our entire app, but also
remove any blog mapper creation logic from our `/blog` route. If we need to
change that logic later on, we'll only have to modify the injector; not the app
routing.
